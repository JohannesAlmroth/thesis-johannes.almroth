I will limit the project by not extending the original study with more than a few additional variables that are relevant to the subject. I will furthermore limit the size of participants to the minimum amount necessary to achieve statistical significancy, if time doesn't permit otherwise. All data gathered will solely be through the same means used in the original 2010 study, the tobii eye tracker as well as interviews.
