% TODO: Rewrite?
A similar project done at KTH in 2019 served as the main inspiration for this paper.\cite{hospital} The goal of the project was to monitor the battery levels in defibrillators via an IoT-enabled scale, and thereby optimize the battery-swapping routine. This project proved successful in it's implementation, but faced a slew of challenges that prevented it from ever being integrated into an actual user environment, due to security concerns related to the use of the hospital Wi-Fi. This shows the importance of seeing the bigger picture of where and how the device will be implemented by the end-user, and having that in mind when making technology and design trade-offs throughout the development process.

One of the implementation details in this project concerned the data polling rate, which potentially affects battery life and device behavior. The ways to regulate data polling is as varied as there are systems and devices that implement it, and some interesting
