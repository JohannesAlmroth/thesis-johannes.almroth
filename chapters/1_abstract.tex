IoT technology has been proclaimed as a new technological prowess that will change our economy, our cities and our way of living. Despite these bold statements, IoT is far from being implemented by ordinary tech companies not directly working with any of the enabling technologies, such as telecom. To bridge this gap, this paper serves as a guiding post on how to implement and program a smaller IoT device connected to an external sensor. Using a microcontroller, a hardware connection with a load cell is implemented. Due to time constraint, the data transmission tests are done with a virtual dataset using Wi-fi. Dimensions such as energy efficacy and data error detection are discussed as well, in addition to future work that could further improve these types of projects. The findings of these paper show that the technology and hardware necessary for this type of project are readily available to the general public and thus can be used in the development of new consumer products.

% For IoT to live up to the excitement and predictions surrounding it, the hardware and the technical know-how needs to be accessible in the form of reasonable price and complexity as well as increased availability in the form of infrastructure and networks. 

% Narrowband-IoT, a new radio protocol focusing on wide area coverage and low power consumption, is being heralded by the 3GPP as one of the key technologies necessary to push society into the age of IoT. Narrowband-IoT networks are still extremely new in a lot of countries, and while the SIM-cards necessary to use these networks can be readily purchased from telecom companies, the lack of implemented projects might scare the companies looking to implementing IoT within their business. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of how an IoT device can be implemented in practicality, with the focus being on using a load cell as a sensor.
