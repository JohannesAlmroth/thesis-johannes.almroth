So far there's been two studies aiming to determine if there is a significant difference between camel casing and underscore casing. The first study conducted by Binkley \etal in 2009 \cite{to-camelCase-or-under-score} with 135 subjects concluded that the camel casing style leads to a better all round performance, at least when the subject is trained on the style, despite taking on average 0.42 seconds longer to read. The second study conducted by Sharif \etal in 2010 \cite{eye-tracking-study} with the help of eye-tracking equipment found that camel cased words took on average 0.932 seconds longer to read, and concludes that the under score style leads to an improvement in both reading time and lessens the amount of visual effort required by the subjects. Visual effort is denoted by how long a subject stares at a given part of the screen, and how often this gaze wanders and switches focus. Even though the two studies differ in their conclusions, the eye-tracking study suffers from a small sample size, with a meagre 15 subjects compared to the 135 subjects in the 2009 study. However, the eye-tracking equipment used in the 2010 study lends a lot of credibility to the data presented, in contrast to the 2009 study where some subjects participated via an online interface in a non-controlled environment that could potentially obfuscate data.
