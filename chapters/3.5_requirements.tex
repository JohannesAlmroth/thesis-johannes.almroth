In this section we will discuss some the software requirements imposed on the IoT-enabled scale device that will be implemented, and what behavior we wish to see from the device in the case of different scenarios. These areas are: data reading rate, data transmission rate, sensor failure as well as sensor disconnect. These areas were chosen because of their relative simple nature, as well as their relevance to other similar devices. The reason no section is dedicated to hardware requirements is because the only requirements in that aspect is that the device functions. Areas such as energy consumption, sizing, etc. would be to vast for the scope and time of this project.

\section{Data Reading Rate}
In most IoT devices the relevant data is provided by some form of sensor, whether it be a scale, thermometer or something entirely different.\cite{what_is_iot} The type of sensor being used has a huge impact on the IoT device, especially when considering that they have to be powered by the same energy source. The simplest way of deciding when to poll data from a sensor is to let it do so at a fixed and constant rate, often enough to be relevant, and seldom enough as to not waste precious energy. However, if within the context of the application we can conclude that no data needs to be polled (for a while), then subsequently no data will need to be sent, and thus we save energy on both ends of the system. For some applications there might even be longer periods of downtime where it's not relevant to conduct monitoring on the given sensor, \eg during nighttime, closing hours, etc. Another interesting angle is modifying the reading rate depending on the data itself. A simple example of a behavior would be to have a slower reading rate at stable values, and increase it when experiencing large enough changes. Given the conditions of an IoT device powered by batteries, it's not unreasonable to assume that readings might not always be accurate at times. Depending on the sensor, spikes and drops of false values might occur, and not taking these scenarios into account would be prudent. 

In this paper, we want the device to change its reading rate depending on the data values, such that the rate increases at periods of activity and change, and lower the rate when the data stabilizes around a given value. We also want the device to try to take false data values into account.

    \caption{Graph with spikes}
    \label{fig:spikes}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{sub@fig:plateu} we see the sensor outputting stable data around a fixed value, to then experiencing a decrease, two times. We want the readings to increase during the data changes, and decrease during the stable plateaus.

In figure \ref{sub@fig:spikes} we see the sensor outputting some data values with sudden spikes in them. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that our scale has the maximum capacity of 100 kg, and thus can easily discern that any value above this is a false reading. In other contexts, false readings might be harder to detect and handle.

\section{Data Transmission Rate}
The transmission of the data is in most cases the operation that consumes the most energy for a lot of devices. The energy amount depends on the hardware and protocol being used, which in turn may affect if a device is programmed to send updates once every minute, or once every day. 

The requirements set on our device states that we need to send the current value of the scale once every ten seconds.

\section{Sensor Failure}
In this paper, we define sensor failure as a sensor giving too many unreliable or false data values to be considered functional. The goal of identifying such a state in an IoT device is to prevent unstable data from being interpreted as valid, which in turn can save the end user from unwanted consequences. Depending on the longevity and purpose of the device, the threshold of when to declare a sensor as failing may differ, especially as this state can be quite fluid. A functional sensor means different things for different devices and applications. A simple way might be to conclude that if x\% of data is considered invalid during the last 24hrs, an alarm should be raised to the device administrator. Complications arise when failures need to be reported quickly, or estimated more thoroughly. It's also possible that the sensor can be temporarily unreliable due to external circumstances, and given enough time, these circumstances might pass. On one extreme you can have a device that reports failures too frequently and bogs down whatever dashboard is handling it's status report. On the other, you can have a device taking too long to determine a sensor failure that otherwise useful data could have been monitored if an error had been raised in time.

The requirements set on our device state that it has to have some form of self-regulation of when to send these error signals, allowing the sensor some time to recover. If the sensor doesn't recover within a given timeframe, or outputs too much erroneous data, it will raise an error. The reason for still raising an error even though the device recovered is that the sensor might be in need of maintenance if the \% of invalid data is too high. This all depends on the filtering of invalid data, as well as at what data threshold the device loses effectivity.

    \label{fig:too_much_invalid}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{sub@fig:recover} the sensor outputs some invalid data, yet it recovers. No errors should be raised.

In figure \ref{sub@fig:no_recover} the sensor doesn't recover from reading invalid data, and an error should be raised.

In figure \ref{sub@fig:too_much_invalid} the sensor does recover, but still outputs enough invalid data that an error should be raised. 


\subsection{Sensor Disconnect}
We define a sensor disconnect as when no credible data is being produced at all. If the sensor doesn't recover, immediate maintenance is needed for any continued functionality. In this device we know that a sensor disconnect results in the value 0.0 being returned at every poll by the microcontroller to the sensor. While this might be a valid read in some scenarios, in a real world application we would probably never get such a stable value at exactly 0.0. Rather, it would fuzz around at maybe 1.5\~0.0. Disregarding this, we can also know that sensor has disconnect if the data values drop to 0.0 at a too quick pace to be a real-world measurement. 

The requirements on this device states that it should raise a disconnect error if the sensor doesn't recover within a given timeframe.

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{disconnect.png}

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{sub@fig:disconnect} the data values drop from 60 to 0 in the span of one data point, which would indicate a sensor disconnect.
