In the original test process subjects were instructed to observe an identifier on a screen, which was then replaced with another four identifiers. One of them matched the previous identifier, whereas the rest of them were incorrect, meant of distract the subject. The data that was then measured is the accuracy of the subject to identify the correct word, as well as the time it took to reach an answer. From the tobii eye tracker additional data such as time spent on each word, amount of fixations vs saccades (eye flicker), can be extracted.
Furthermore, data such as subject age, experience and background will be extracted in an interview like setting.
