Internet of Things (IoT) has been lauded as a world-changing technology that will significantly affect our economy as well as our way of living. In a report by the GSMA, the total number of IoT devices is estimated to triple by 2025, bringing the total number of devices to \$25.2 \textit{billion}. Meanwhile, the global IoT revenue will fourfold from 2018, increasing it to \$4.4 \textit{billion}.\cite{gsma-report} While there undeniably is a lot of excitement and potential economic impact associated with IoT, many consumers just associate the term with connecting a common toaster or coffee machine to a Wi-Fi network. While this technically fits the definition for an IoT device\cite{what_is_iot}, the significant use cases will probably be implemented with different sensors, such as scales, thermometers, etc. that will further improve automatization \& optimization processes. As an example, the key categories within the predicted growth is smart homes (e.g. security devices) and smart buildings (e.g. energy consumption sensors).\cite{gsma-report} For the predicted growth to happen, businesses need to take a chance and work on projects that implements different IoT technologies, and to enable this, the GSMA has developed some LPWAN (Low-Power Wide-Area Network) protocols that focus on different key aspects that make IoT possible. Some of these aspect include long battery life, high connection density, indoor coverage and geo-tracking capabilities. However, it would be an educated guess to assume that the biggest hindrance to 

This paper will focus on the implementation of an IoT device, and highlight the practical and structural challenges that need to be taken into account when starting this kind of project. The aim of this paper is to familiarize the reader with the basic workings and needs of such a device, and leave them with a rough idea of what they need to do to implement their own device with an appropriate sensor. 

The IoT device that will be implemented is a basic microcontroller connected to a load cell. The practical work can be divided into two parts: enabling communication between the load cell and microcontroller, as well as connecting the microcontroller to a cloud service.

The signal output of a load cell is in mV/V\cite{load-cell-spec}. Simply put, what this means is that when the loading cell is at full weight capacity, it will output \textit{x} amount of mV per V the device is supplied. \eg a load cell with the full scale output of 3.0 mV/V, and the recommended excitation of 10V, will output 3.0 * 10 = 30 mV at full weight capacity. The remaining range of 0-30mV is used to signify the remaining range of the weight capacity from 0 to \textit{x} kgs. To correctly tie these signals to a weight unit, a calibration is needed. To send this electric analog signal to a microcontroller, we will need some form of ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). Considering the system as a whole, we need to power the load cell, ADC and microcontroller with the same power source and ground, as to not cause any electrical interference throughout the different parts. Practically, this means that the choice of hardware will be affected by what voltage the power source is able to provide. Ideally, the microcontroller, ADC and load cell would all require the same amount of voltage as to not overcomplicate. 

To enable wireless communication with some form of web service, the microcontroller will need to settle for a suitable wireless protocol. It would seem suitable that we go for one of the previously mentioned LPWAN technologies that the 3GPP developed for the specific purpose of being used with IoT devices.

% TODO: [Comment] I think it would be helpful for the introduction to focus on the two main parts 1. load cell -> microcontroller (and amplifier & ADC), as well as 2. microcontroller -> cloud service (nb iot / mobile network) // Why might it be useful to have wireless scales that send data to the cloud.

% TODO: [Comment] Maybe also data on cloud -> useful application (not main goal for you)



\section{Purpose and Goals}

The goal of this paper is to familiarize the reader with an IoT device. Practically, this will be done by establish a working internet connection with a load cell through a microcontroller. The data sent from the load cell should be functionally identical to the data produced if the load cell was offline. Disregarding problems due to a internet service provider, data speeds and losses should not be abnormal. Using the same components, replication of the project should be feasible with the documentation provided in this thesis, assuming similar software and service providers remain. 


\section{Delimitations}
The end goal of the paper is to document and outline the steps needed to implement a functioning data upload from a load cell to the internet via NB-IoT. The final implementation will not be a functional product ready to be taken into commercial use. Any extra improvements upon a NB-IoT enabled load cell will only be done if time remains after the implementation and the completion of the thesis. The reason for this is due to a limited time budget, since this project is done within the framework for a bachelor's thesis.

% TODO: [Comment] Does this part makes sense based on material in previous paragraphs? Maybe better suited for later?
When starting this project, several factors motivated the choice for hardware. Since existing work on NB-IoT at Uppsala university has been done on the microcontroller FiPy, and the available expertise would make troubleshooting simpler, a FiPy was chosen for this project as well. Furthermore, since the Computer Communications group at Uppsala University have an ongoing contract(\textbf{wording?}) to use Telia's NB network, the choice for which tele-carrier to use was also quite simple. The load cell, a Tedea Huntleigh - Model 1022 was provided by Vetek, as it was deemed a simple and basic model which would be suitable for this kind of pilot project. Since the output of a load cell is measured in mV/V\cite{load-cell-spec}, some form of mediator is needed between the microcontroller and the load cell. A similar implementation made at KTH \cite{hospital} used a load cell amplifier, HX711, to convert the data to a digital format. After some research online, no alternatives were cheap or simple enough to warrant a different purchase. The readily available documentation and tutorials were also a compelling argument for using the HX711.
