Vetek is a Swedish scale supplier located in Väddö, situated approx. 100 kilometers north of Stockholm. Vetek constructs their own scales and weighing systems, as well as reselling products from other manufacturers. Vetek aims to improve their services, and as such are interested in the possible use cases IoT (Internet of Things) technology that could be combined with their products. IoT implies refers simply to connecting a device to the internet\cite{what_is_iot}, and would in this case refer to a scale, or more precisely, a load cell. NB-IoT (Narrowband-IoT), a new and emerging radio technology, encapsulates some principles suitable for this type of endeavor, such as increased coverage, low power consumption and reduced complexity.\cite{NB-overview}

The goal of this project is to establish a working internet connection with a load cell. The data sent from the load cell should be functionally identical to the data produced if the load cell was offline. Disregarding problems due to the service provider, data speeds and losses should not be abnormal. Using the components previously mentioned
