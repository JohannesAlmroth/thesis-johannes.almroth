% Paragraph of IoT
IoT (Internet of Things) is a broad, diverse and growing field within the IT sector. Many organizations predict that it will come to impact large areas of our daily life, and many telecom companies are experimenting with different kinds of real world applications that can benefit from this change. The basic idea is the same for everything, which is to take a device and connect it to the internet. Examples range from simple toasters to complex self-driving cars.\cite{what_is_iot} The focus is to enable communication between devices without the need for a human middleman, thus optimizing whatever application is being implemented. A simple example is a building equipped with multiple IoT-enabled thermostats, which are controlled by a central heating system. Given effective software, heating can be regulated in an energy efficient manner while still keeping visitors adequately warm throughout the day. Another example might be a parking meter, which can forward the availability of its parking spot to some central system which in turn forwards the closest available spot to an end-user. The potential applications are numerous, but factors such as energy consumption and security have proven to be considerable roadblocks that pose huge challenges to most IoT projects.

% Intro about Vetek
Vetek is a Swedish scale supplier located in Väddö, situated approx. 100 kilometers north of Stockholm. Vetek constructs their own scales and weighing systems, as well as reselling products from other manufacturers.\cite{vetek} 

% Vetek + IoT
Vetek aims to improve their services, and as such are interested in the possible use cases of IoT technology, and ultimately see how that can be applied to their own products. With something as simple as an IoT-enabled scale, they can offer customers products that can be placed in remote areas without the need for constant checkups, enabling long term monitoring and easier analyze of data. An example might be monitoring road salt depots, to enable smarter refill routes during winter time, or a fodder station to map the behaviors of local wildlife.

% Challenges
The largest challenges for this type of device lies in energy consumption and broadcast range. Low energy consumption is needed so that any maintainer doesn't need to make constant check-ups to switch batteries all the time. This poses limitation on the type of scale that can be used, which in extension affects parameters such as scale accuracy and capacity. A wide broadcast range is needed so that the device isn't limited to being close to a base station. This puts restraints on what type of communication protocols can be used, as traditional ones such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth won't work in the aforementioned examples.

% Available tech
With the advent of IoT, the 3GPP (3:rd Generation Partnership Program, a standardization organization for telecom) has developed new wireless communication protocols intended to be used by these devices. 
%TODO: Add citation
One of these, the NB-IoT (Narrowband-IoT) protocol is particularly suitable for the challenges mentioned above, as its focus lies (among else) in wide area coverage and long battery life. A microcontroller (a small computer) is needed to handle the data polled from the scale, as well as sending it via some wireless communication protocol. The microcontroller chosen for this project is a FiPy, as it has the capability to handle multiple wireless technologies, one of them being NB-IoT. Some other essential pieces of hardware needed is some form of power supply, as well as an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) that connects the microcontroller and the scale.

% What I did
In this paper, an attempt is made to implement and NB-IoT enabled load cell (the term load cell is interchangeable with scale for all intents and purposes). Due to hardware difficulties, a functioning connection between the load cell and the microcontroller could not be established while transmitting data, so some dummy data was transmitted later on. Some behavioral restrictions are placed on the code running the microcontroller, to closer resemble a real-world application. Examples of these behaviors are handling of erroneous data and disconnection of the scale.

%Background
In the following chapter, some general background information regarding the IoT technology and industry as a whole will be presented, as well as the predictions surrounding it. The purpose of NB-IoT and its market situation in Sweden will also be discussed. 
%Requirements
In order to emulate some behavior needed in the context of a real-world application, a few requirements have been placed on the device in the way that it handles the polling and transmission of data. The desired behavior is of an all-purpose IoT scale, with the requirements being set by Vetek.  These requirements will be presented in the Requirements chapter.
%Methodology
The hardware and software implementation of the device will be presented in the Methodology chapter.
% Results & Discussion
The outcome of the implementation will be presented in the Results \& Discussion chapter, and
%Conclusions & future work
conclusions as well as a discussion of possible future work are brought up in the final chapter.
