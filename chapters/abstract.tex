The purpose of this paper is to replicate the results of two earlier studies, Binkley \etal ~~(2009) as well as Sharif \etal ~~(2010), where the aim was to determine if the identifier naming conventions affected code comprehension. The two styles that were examined are camelCasing as well as the snake\_case style.
