The purpose of this paper is to replicate the results of two earlier studies, Binkley \etal ~~(2009) as well as Sharif \etal ~~(2010), where the aim was to determine if the identifier naming conventions affected code comprehension. The two styles that are examined are camelCasing as well as the under\_score style. The study is conducted by using an eye-tracking device to gather data through a timed responsed test.
