Many thanks to Vetek, who funded the purchase of all the hardware equipment used in the project. I am grateful to the  Communication Research Lab at Uppsala university for providing me with space and tools to conduct my work.

I would like to thank, especially, Laura Feeney PhD, for your outstanding patience, words of encouragement as well as your time spent in guiding me. In addition, I would like to thank professor Per Gunningberg.

Heartfelt thanks to my partner, Sabina Smedsrud, for always cheering me up and supporting me throughout this journey.
